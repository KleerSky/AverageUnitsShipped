Activate Strict with 'option strict on'

CONSTANTS
lower limit for input as 0
upper limit for input as 1001

VARIABLES
Empty string for user input
variable for the integer output of tryparse on user input
create an array with 7 spaces
create an integer called index to use as counter and index
create integer known as sum to hold totals for processing
create double known as result of average to hold resulting average, with decimals

WHEN FORM LOADS
Make lblDayNumber print 'Day 1' or 'Day ' & index+1

WHEN ENTER IS CLICKED
Save whatever is in input textbox to userInput string

Test if it is an integer (TryParse)
	If not, Throw error, decrement index, refocus on input textbox
	
If it is an integer, Test if it is between 0 and 1000 range
	If not, Throw error, decrement index, refocus on input textbox

If it is between range - HOORAY! - proceed with processing
	Set day label to 'Day ' & index + 1, updating day counter
	Save integer from the TryParse as the userInput string
	Save userInput into the multi-line textbox, and carriage return
	Make input textbox blank and refocus, for next input
	
	IF AT ANY POINT index hits the end (length of array minus 1)
		Save textbox value to userInput string
		Disable input textbox
		Disable enter button
		Empty input textbox
		
		For every element in the array, from 0 to the end (array length minus 1)
			Add them up to the sum variable
		
		Average result is the sum / length of array
		Round Average Result
		Print Average Result 
	
You are Done!
